JPL 1.0.1 released.&nbsp; This release contains the following changes:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Fixed a bug with the representation of Tuples.&nbsp; They are now <I>always</I>
binary terms, though generally structured as binary trees.&nbsp; The interface
is the same, except we now require that Tuples contain <I>at least</I>
two elements.&nbsp; (The single element constructor has been removed, but
I consider this a patch, not an interface change)</LI>

<LI>
Added an ith() accessor to the Compound and Query classes. This is used
to obtain the ith element in the array of Terms in the Compound or Query.</LI>

<LI>
Added a debugString() method to the Term and Query classes.&nbsp; This
is used to obtain more detailed information about the structure of the
Term or Query.</LI>

<LI>
Updated and fixed some of the documentation.</LI>

<LI>
JPL is now released under the terms of the Gnu Library Public License,
not the Gnu General Public License.&nbsp; All relevant files have been
updated.</LI>

<LI>
JPL 1.0.0 is out.&nbsp; Check the <A HREF="#Download">download</A> section
for information about how to retrieve it.&nbsp; I <I>hope</I> most of the
core interfaces are frozen.</LI>

<LI>
I am in need of Solaris testers!&nbsp; I have access to a Solaris box,
but it has ancient and outdated compilers, libs, etc.&nbsp; If anyone gets
this to compile on any platform other than Linux, please send me patches.</LI>

<LI>
Eventually I'd like to work out some config scripts.&nbsp; For now you
must config manually.&nbsp; Sorry.</LI>

<LI>
I have not even tried getting this to run under Windows.&nbsp; Anyone with
more expertise (and patience) than I is welcome to give it a go!</LI>

<A NAME="General Description"></A>General Description</H3>
JPL is a set of Java classes and C functions providing an interface between
Java and Prolog.&nbsp; JPL uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to connect
to a Prolog engine through the Prolog Foreign Language Interface (FLI),
which is more or less in the process of being standardized in various implementations
of Prolog.&nbsp; JPL is not a pure Java implementation of Prolog; it makes
extensive use of native implementations of Prolog on supported platforms.&nbsp;
The current version of JPL only works with SWI-Prolog.
<P>Currently, JPL only supports the embedding of a Prolog engine within
the Java VM.&nbsp; Future versions may support the embedding of a Java
VM within Prolog, so that, for example, one could take advantage of the
rich class structure of the Java environment from within Prolog.
<P>JPL is designed in two layers, a low-level interface to the Prolog FLI
and a high-level Java interface for the Java programmer who is not concerned
with the details of the Prolog FLI.&nbsp; The low-level interface is provided
for C programmers who may wish to port their C implementations which use
the FLI to Java with minimal fuss.

JPL now requires SWI-Prolog version 3.1.0 or later, which is available
at the following URL:

SWI-Prolog is free for non-commercial use.&nbsp; Contact the author, Jan
Wielemaker, for commercial license information:

You will also need a Java 1.1.x development environment.&nbsp; The Sun
JDK is a good place to start:

JPl was written and tested on Linux kernel 2.1.24.&nbsp; It should compile
on any other UNIX system with a full suite of gnu tools.&nbsp; JPL has
not been ported to Wintel systems.
