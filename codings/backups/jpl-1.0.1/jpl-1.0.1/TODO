To Do
-----

    o Complete the definition of jpl.fli.Prolog.  My feeling is that
    this class should mirror, as much as possible, the C header file
    SWI-Prolog.h.  It should at least contain implementations of the
    "standard" FLI functions.  This is easy -- it just needs to be done.
	[Once this is done, I think we can remove the alpha release tag.]
    
    o Testing.  This stuff is barely tested.  We need people to run it
    through the ropes, but the jpl.fli package and the jpl package.
    
    o Documentation.  It would be nice to have a real document explaining
    the inner workings (even though it's really quite simple), in
    addition to the interfaces.  Something more than the JPL.NOTES
    I have (a start, at any rate), and something that complements the
    javadoc stuff.  I suggest we do it in html.
    
    o Volunteers!  Right now I'm the only one working on this, but
    I'm sure there is interest out there.  [If you're interested, please
    let me know.  --Fred]
