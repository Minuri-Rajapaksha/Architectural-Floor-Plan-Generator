Description
-----------

JPL is a set of Java classes and C functions providing an interface
between Java and Prolog.  JPL uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to
connect to a Prolog engine through the Prolog Foreign Language Interface
(FLI), which is more or less in the process of being standardized in
various implementations of Prolog.  JPL is not a pure Java implementation 
of Prolog; it makes extensive use of native implementations of Prolog
on supported platoforms.  The current version of JPL only works with
SWI-Prolog.

Currently, JPL only supports the embedding of a Prolog engine within the
Java VM.  Future versions may support the embedding of a Java VM
within Prolog, so that, for example, one could take advantage of
the rich class structure of the Java environment from within Prolog.

JPL is designed in two layers, a low-level interface to the Prolog
FLI and a high-level Java interface for the Java programmer who
is not concerned with the details of the Prolog FLI.  The
low-level interface is provided for C programmers who may wish
to port their C implementations which use the FLI to Java with
minimal fuss.  See the file JPL.NOTES for more information.



Directories
-----------


./jsrc   The Java source tree.  The directory structure of this
         tree mirror the package structure of the Java classes.
./src    The native C implementation of the JPL Prolog interface
./lib    Java class files (in the classes directory), jar files,
         zip files, and shared object files.
./doc    Hand-written and Javadoc-generated documentation
./test   Simple test scripts for testing the system.
./demo   Simple demo program.  See the Getting Started section
         of the manual for a description.
