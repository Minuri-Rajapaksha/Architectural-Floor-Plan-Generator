    Build Instructions for JPL
    --------------------------
    
    
This file contains instructions for building JPL under SWI-Prolog.


Requirements
------------

1. You will need  SWI-Prolog, version 3.0.0 or higher.  
SWI-Prolog is available at the following site:

    ftp://swi.psy.uva.nl/pub/SWI-Prolog
    
SWI-Prolog is free for non-commercial use.  Contact the author 
(Jan Wielemaker) for commercial licenses.

2. JPL uses the JNI for creating an interface between Java and Prolog,
so you will need the JDK 1.1.x to build the system.

3. The native implementation is built and tested with egcs 1.0.2, but
nothing specific to egcs is used.  gcc 2.7.x should work fine.  In
fact, any C compiler should work, but the Makefiles may need to be 
tinkered with.

JPL was built and tested under Linux 2.1.24 for the PowerPC.


Instructions
------------

    1. You may need to modify the rules.mk file in the top level
    directory.  Instructions for doing so are included in rules.mk
    
    2. Type
    
        make
    
    at the root directory of the source distribution.  This will build
    the class, jar, zip, and .so files in the ./lib directory.
    
    That's it!  Should you choose to actually *use* this software,
    you'll want to place the jar and .so files in a location appropriate
    for your system.  There are no installation directives in the
    supplied Makefiles.

	To compile and run the test and demo prorgrams, first make sure the 
	.jar and .so files are built and in a directory known to your CLASSPATH
	and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and type make in the appropriate directories.
